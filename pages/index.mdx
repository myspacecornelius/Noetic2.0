  - **Phase 1 - Anchor**: Acquire and integrate flagship CNS company  
  - **Phase 2 - Bolt-Ons**: Strategic acquisitions to expand platform capabilities
  - **Phase 3 - Scale**: Optimize operations and drive synergistic value creation
  - **Phase 4 - Exit**: Maximize value realization through strategic exit opportunities
